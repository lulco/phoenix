## Init command
`php vendor/bin/phoenix init [-e|--environment ENVIRONMENT] [-c|--config CONFIG] [-t|--config_type CONFIG_TYPE] [-f|--output-format OUTPUT-FORMAT]`

Initializes phoenix and creates database table where executed migrations will be stored in. This command is executed automatically with first run of other commands, so you don't have to run it manually.

All options are common and they are described [here](commands.md).
